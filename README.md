Welcome to **Zombie Shooter** 🧟‍♂️🔥💥 

Step into a fast-paced, heart-pounding **3D HTML survival experience** built completely from the ground up by me and my friend 🚀🧠. What started as a small late-night idea quickly evolved into a full-scale fight for survival — and now it’s *your* turn to step into the chaos and test your skills against the apocalypse 🌍⚠️.

The undead are coming… and they’re not stopping. 🧟‍♀️🧟‍♂️
Fight through relentless waves of zombies as they close in from every direction. Stay sharp. Stay moving. Stay alive. 🔫💨 Every second counts as you dodge attacks, line up your shots, and desperately reload before the next swarm reaches you. Miss too many shots and you’re done. Hesitate for a second and they’ll surround you. 😱💀

As time goes on, the challenge ramps up fast. ⏳🔥
Faster zombies. Bigger hordes. Smarter movement. Less room for mistakes. The battlefield becomes more intense with every wave, pushing your reflexes, aim, and strategy to the limit. Can you handle the pressure when your screen fills with chaos and your ammo is running low? 🎯💣

Master your strategy and find your playstyle.
Go for clean precision headshots 🧠🎯 or spray and pray when you’re cornered 😤🔫. Conserve your ammo wisely, reposition constantly, and keep your distance — because once they trap you, there’s no escape. Every run feels different. Every match is unpredictable. Every survival attempt is a new story. 📖🔥

Challenge yourself to beat your high score 🏆📈 and prove you’ve got what it takes to outlast the apocalypse. Compete with your friends. Brag about your longest survival time. Or dive back in again and again until you become unstoppable. 💪😈

This isn’t just a game — it’s a test of focus, reaction speed, and pure survival instinct. 🧠⚡
The question is simple…

**How long can YOU survive?** 🕒🧟‍♂️

Good luck out there… you’re definitely going to need it. 💀🔥
